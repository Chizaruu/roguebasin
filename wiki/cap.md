# Cap

---

Some games distinguish between the harder head [armor](armor.md) of a helm or [helmet](helmet.md) and softer, less protective head coverings that can be classified as caps. In [Crawl](linleys_dungeon_crawl.md), having horns on your head can prevent you from wearing a helmet, while allowing you to wear a cap.
