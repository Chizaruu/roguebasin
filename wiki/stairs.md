# Stairs

---

In many roguelikes **stairs** are the main method of moving from one [level](level.md) to another. There are usually represented by < for stairs going up and > for stairs going down, though this is curiously inverted in [Alphaman](alphaman.md). In some roguelikes, such as [Nethack](nethack.md), descending stairs while burdened can result in a nasty (and possibly fatal) fall. [Crawl](linleys_dungeon_crawl.md) forbids going up a level while overburdened.

The level transition function of stairs may be performed by any other [dungeon feature](dungeon_feature.md). Examples include portals, gates, holes and trapdoors (often one-way), teleporters and dimension doors. [DoomRL](doomrl.md) allows saving only on stairs to next level.

Sometimes it may block line of sight or projectiles. Elevators in [Xenocide](xenocide.md) do.

Few roguelikes allow for stair demolition. This dungeon feature is often exploited. It is known as [stair dancing](cheating.md#stair-dancing). Games differ whether [monsters](monster.md) may follow the player to another level or not.
