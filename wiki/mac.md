## Roguelike games supporting Mac OS

---

This list represents both games that have been compiled natively to Mac OS X and games that were developed in Java and are therefore platform independent. The only Java based roguelikes on this list are the ones that have been tested explicitly on Mac OS X, but you can also browse the full list of [Java Roguelikes](java.md#Java_Roguelikes). Be warned that in most Roguelikes, diagonal movement is essential. The absence of a numpad on the MacBook will generally make such movement either impossible without some sort of external keyboard or numpad, or you will need to use Vi keys for movement.
