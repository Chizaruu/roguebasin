# Linux

---

Linux is a Free Software kernel but the term is also, and usually, used to refer to an [operating system](platforms.md) using the Linux Kernel.

Linux is in many ways similar to [Unix](unix.md), so you should look [its page](unix.md). The original [Rogue](rogue.md) was also initially released for Unix in 1980, meaning it was able to be ported to Linux with less hassle.
