# Finding graphical tiles

---

This is an index into the various sites that provide tiles suitable for roguelike development. Some tilesets are designed to work with specific roguelike games.

When adding links, please make note of:

- The license for using the tilesets,
- Any games that the tilesets are designed specifically for,
- The size & style of the tiles.

These links are all external, as it isn't really the place of RogueBasin to be hosting tilesets any more than it should be hosting roguelikes.

## Other useful links

---

- If you'd like to generate and manipulate graphical tiles at runtime from within the code instead of loading them from image files, so that they are "embedded" in the executable file, there is a C++, SDL-based library called **XTiles** which is especially suited for roguelike game graphics. It is very small and easy to use. The project appears to have been abandoned. An archive of the blog can be found at <https://web.archive.org/web/20170410060324/http://xtiles.blogspot.com/>, and the source code at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xtiles/files/>. XTiles is open-source.

- [Lost Garden](http://lostgarden.com/labels/free%20game%20graphics.html) also has some free graphic sets. These are not directly roguelike, but could still be useful.

- During 2009 [Prof. Engd's ????tag????re of Hypnopompic Hexadecimal Miniature Monsters](http://monster.tacolab.com/) has a new monster each weekday. Released under [cc by-nc-sa](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) license.
