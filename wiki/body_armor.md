# Body armor

---

Body armor is [armor](armor.md) that protects the torso and possibly the arms and/or legs of the wearer. It is generally the best form of protection against physical attacks, with auxiliary pieces of armor contributing lesser protection. It also tends to have the heaviest drawbacks in terms of hampering agility or [magic](magic.md) use. Reducing magic use is done for game balance, if spellcasters are able to use all kinds of armor/weapons, the difficulty of playing a spellcaster is reduced.
