### About The Review

This review of [Tower of Doom](tower_of_doom.md) was based on version 001.

It was tested under Windows XP.

### Synopsis

I really hope copx keeps this feel together, as this is a playable game out of the box!

### Features

It is newbie friendly. Despite making character creation choices at random and not knowing where the hit points are, it is still very fun.

Infinite ammo is a brilliant concept. Resist the temptation to remove this feature!

### Drawbacks

The problems encountered during the review process have been fixed in later versions.
