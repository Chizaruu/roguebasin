# Boots

---

Boots are protective covering for the feet and therefore qualify as [armor](armor.md). Most games include [shoes](shoes.md) together with boots with no distinction except in name. In addition to possible magical powers and basic armor protection, boots might:

- be more or less stealthy than the default state.
- allow one to walk on difficult surfaces more easily, such as ice.
  - could even come with skates or skis in an appropriate game setting.
- make kicking attacks more effective.
- allow one to walk on certain surfaces without damage (e.g. broken glass).
