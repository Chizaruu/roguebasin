# Inspired Art

---

The roguelike genre inspires many game designers... but not only them. Some artists have been inspired by roguelikes to create art of other kind.

- [ADOM Gallery](http://www.adom.de/adom/gallery.php3) includes "ASCII Art in 3D" and other pictures.

- [A roguelike trailer](http://fin.broodwar.com/dbd-alpha.avi) (a video clip).

- [Penance](http://www.penancecomic.com/), a roguelike webcomic (inspired by [Angband](angband.md) variants).
