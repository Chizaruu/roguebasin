# Acid

---

Acid is fairly common form of destructive material in roguelike games. It may be considered an [elemental](element.md) force in the [magic](magic.md) system. It can appear as a means of physical attack in non-fantasy settings as well. It is often the most destructive attack form in terms of damage done to the player's [items](items.md), even if the damage done to living things is not great. It may be available only to [monsters](monster.md) or to the [PC](player_character.md) as well.
