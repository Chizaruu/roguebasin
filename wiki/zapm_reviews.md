# ZapM Reviews

It was played under Debian.

The version of [ZapM](zapm.md) was around 0.6.2.

This game is far from complete, and definitely not well balanced, but
I think/hope it's reached a certain fun-to-play stage. And after
reading that earlier thread about appropriate release times, I've
decided I might as well find out sooner than later if my game sucks.
```

Well, I'm afraid to say it doesn't suck :> If you were looking for an excuse to quit development, you're not getting it from me.

I only had time to play a couple of games, but it pulled me in. The pace is fast and fun. You have managed to build a sci-fi nethack without any of the usual cop-outs. Usually one would just say scrolls==disks and be done. But, you have tweaked the stuff so it all feels internally consistent.

You have also shown infinite evil in your [RNG](random_number_generator.md), which gave my poor space marine a pair of buggy peril sensitive sunglasses and a buggy cortext crossover. The cruelty of that last device defies description. I am in awe.

So, please give it a whirl if you have a Mac or a Linux box:

Those on Windows boxes can do what I do, and run VMWare. That being said, my Fedora install didn't want to run it due to some C runtime library problem. I had to run it under Debian.

...and let me know what you think!

Keep up the good work! Wish I had infinite time so I could play it enough to give you some real feedback. Sadly, I'm chained to the iterative development process you know so well trying improve my own roguelike.
