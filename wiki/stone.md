# Stone

---

Stone is pretty much the same thing as [rock](rock.md), although some games, notably [Crawl](linleys_dungeon_crawl.md) distinguish them.

A stone is also a unit of mass measurement in the Imperial system, equivalent to 14 pounds or 6.35 kilogrammes. Some games have used the stone in this meaning, notably [ADOM](adom.md), where the stone was the only measurement unit to express item mass (interestingly, the PC's body mass could be expressed either in pounds or kilogrammes, according to the game's configuration). As [Thomas Biskup](thomas_biskup.md) stated, a stone in ADOM is equivalent to 50 grammes.
