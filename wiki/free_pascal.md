# Free Pascal

---

Although of the [major roguelikes](major_roguelikes.md) only [Moria](moria.md) was written in [Pascal](pascal.md), quite a few of the recently developed roguelikes were made in an open-source implementation of that language called Free Pascal.

A very modern implementation of the Pascal language. It is a very portable language, being available for processors Intel x86, Amd64/x86 64, PowerPC, Sparc and Motorola 680x0; and the following operating systems: [Linux](linux.md), FreeBSD, NetBSD, [Mac OS X](mac_os_x.md)/Darwin, [Mac OS](mac.md) classic, [DOS](dos.md), [Win32](windows.md), OS/2, BeOS, SunOS, QNX, Classic Amiga. It is a 32/64 bit compiler. It is quite compatible with Borland Pascal and strives to be compatible with Delphi (thanks to the [Lazarus Project](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/)). It has several enhancements over classical Pascal, as for example:

- Function and procedure overloading
- Operator overloading
- Classes
- Java-like interfaces
- Exceptions
- Properties

A notable resource for Free Pascal developers is the [Valkyrie Framework](valkyrie_framework.md).
