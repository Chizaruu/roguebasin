# Player character

---

A **Player Character**, or **PC**, is a fictional in-game avatar that the [player](player.md) of the game is in direct control of, or has the ability to take control of. The PC is usually the hero of the game, and is generally represented by an [@](@.md) symbol.

This terminology is derived from that of role-playing games, notably [Dungeons & Dragons](dungeons_and_dragons.md).
