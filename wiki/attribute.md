# Attribute

---

An _attribute_ is a measurable property of a given [character](character.md). Generally attributes define how developed a character is in regards to different aspects of the game. Sometimes attributes will remain the same throughout the duration of the game, while other times, as a character progresses, these might be altered by the game. Character [classes](class.md) might also play a role in determining default attributes for a character. Below is an list of some common attributes used:

- Strength: A measure of physical force that can be exerted upon other things, or the ability of a character to perform some physical action.
- Dexterity: A measure of physical control, accuracy, or precision in relation to certain actions.
- Agility: A measure of speed or the deftness of movement.
- Vitality: Also "constitution" or "vigor". A measure of health or the ability to resist physical ailments like poison or illness.
- Toughness: Also "stamina" or "fortitude". A measure of the ability to resist fatigue and strain resulting from activity, combat, or otherwise. Sometimes interchangeable with "vitality".
- Wisdom: A measure of mental aptitude, which might affect the strength or efficiency of [magic](magic.md), and the ability to detect things or have some sort of increased foresight.
- Luck: A measure of how favorable the odds are against the character, for things such as treasure drops or damage rolls.
- Charisma: Although generally near useless it does warrant mentioning since several major roguelikes inherited it as part of standard D&D attribute set. Measure of how good a character is at bartering in spite of what the name suggests.

## Non-static attributes

---

Some attributes are constantly changing, depending on the situations in the game:

- Health: Also "[hit points](hit_points.md)". A measure of how much damage a character can sustain. Death almost always occurs after health falls to a certain point. Health can usually be regained by using [potions](potions.md) or [spells](spell.md), or through regeneration.
- [Mana](mana.md): A measure of the character's ability to perform magic or other skills. Mana can usually be recovered by using potions or regeneration, similar to health.
- [Hunger](hunger.md): A measure of how "hungry" a character is. Usually this describes how inept a character is to perform a given action, or might cause death once reaching a critical point. [Food](food.md) will decrease the amount of hunger a character has, but the availability of it may or may not be scarce.
- Fatigue: A measure of how physically and mentally able a character is, and how the character is affected in-game.
- Wealth: Some games do not treat possessed gold as physical item but instead opt just to hold numerical value of collected money.
- Accuracy: More often labeled "to hit chance". Describes how likely a character is to successfully hit. Melee and ranged accuracy are often two different attributes.
- Damage inflicted: A measure of how capable a character is at killing monsters with attacks that hit. Usually expressed as a range and is not always explicitly stated.
- Encumbrance: Indicates how much weight is carried. Passing certain levels of encumbrance may inflict penalties on character.

## Advancement attributes

---

Attributes that continually increase (or increment in one direction), have their own classification. They may reset after reaching a certain point, but generally these will accumulate, reflecting the progress the character has made.

- [Experience](experience.md): A measure of how much a character has developed, usually over the course of a game. This might be increased by defeating enemies, collecting items, completing quests, or simply progressing through the game. Many experience systems award an increase in character level after a certain mark has been reached.
- [Level](level.md): An extension of the experience attribute. Typically, once enough experience has been gathered, a character may advance to a higher level, where more spells, abilities, locations, et cetera, may now be accessible.
