# Radiation

---

Radiation is an long term effect or [attack type](monster_attacks.md) present in some roguelikes. Its fantasy counterpart is [magical](magic.md) contamination.

Games implementing radiation:

- [Xenocide](xenocide.md): Radiation works like poison with the subtle difference high doses may cause [mutations](mutation.md) to appear. These are usually bad.
- [ZapM](zapm.md): Radiation has no effect until exposure reaches critical level. When this happens radiation sickness strikes and while it lasts [hero](player_character.md) will take constitution and strength damage.
