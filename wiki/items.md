## Classic Roguelike Theme Categories

---

The item categories are closely related to the game theme, and serve different functionalities. The following are some empiric categories based on the classic roguelike theme:  

### Potions

Symbolizes a liquid that can be drunk, normally only once, provoking special effects on the entity that drank from it; in this aspect, it is similar to the scroll, but its effects are commonly more direct on the performer.  

Some games allow different uses of potions, including throwing them to cause different kinds of damage or special effects on the world, like explosions and gas clouds.  

Also, the alchemy [skill](skill.md) or its equivalent may allow a character to generate potions with different effects based on other items and/or recipes that can be found inside the game.  

### Scrolls

A scroll is a rolled sheet of paper that contains a [magical](magic.md) effect. Upon reading the scroll, the magic invokes an effect in the reader or the world around him. A scroll commonly disappears after its first (or more) uses.  

The typical scroll has an exterior label. One model is that a player, in unrolling the scroll, looks at (thereby reading) the interior words and activates the scroll. [NetHack](nethack.md) uses a different model where the label is the only wording on the scroll; the player activates the scroll by uttering the words aloud. In this way, a character can activate a scroll even while blind, having earlier seen and memorized the label.  

### Books

Books are main sources of [magical](magic.md) knowledge and [spells](spell.md).  

### Lighting

Lanterns, torches, lamps, or other such devices allow the player to see in a dark area. Most such devices must be refueled after a set number of turns, but some games also provide magic versions that last forever.  

### Food

Food rations, fruits, candies, and other edible items prevent the hero from starving. Many games also classify the corpses of dead monsters as food. In some games, food can have [magical](magic.md) or healing effects. Some games challenge the player to escape starvation by limiting the supply of food.  

### Weapons

Weapons enhance battling capabilities of wielder. Often an appropriate [skill](skill.md) is needed to use them effectively.  

It is typical for the player to wield a weapon, then walk into a opponent to attack it. Many games also provide ranged weapons, such as the sling and rocks. The player equips a sling, then fires rocks over multiple squares into an enemy. Some games restrict the player to firing in eight directions; others allow the player to aim for arbitrary nearby targets. Games differ in how well players can shoot around corners.  

### Armor

Armor protects body of creature wearing it from damage. Heavy armor may hinder maneuverability to some extent. In some games, armor hinders magic, especially gloves and metal armor.  

Games typically provide many armor slots, so that characters can simultaneously wear a helmet, boots, gloves, upper and lower body armor, cloak, and shield simultaneously.  

### Jewelry

Most common items belonging to jewelry category are rings and amulets. They may modify [character](character.md)'s attributes, grant various powers, special ability or resistance. Also they can allow [magical](magic.md) power or [spell](spell.md) to be activated. Some these items have been known to contain souls or creatures within.  

The main difference between amulets and rings is that former often are better and more valuable but sometimes they offer different advantages.  

### Wands

A wand is a kind of item that invokes certain power which is commonly unknown at first place, the wands have a limited number of charges or uses, and can be recharged using other actions.  

### Rods

Rod is an item similar to wand but employs different power source. Rods use energy of wielder to create desired effect or absorb it slowly from environment effectively being usable only once per certain period of time.  

### Staves

A long Pole-like weapon with no cutting edge, often appear in games as [magic](magic.md) staves, similar in function to wands, though often possessing more than ability and often being inexhaustible.
