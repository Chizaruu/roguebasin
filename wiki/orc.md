# Orc

---

An orc is a [humanoid](humanoid.md) foe, common to most fantasy roguelikes. Orcs may come in a wide variety, representing different tribes or subspecies (hill orcs, valley orcs, tunnel orcs) or specialists (orc captain, orc wizard, orc shaman). They frequently have access to ranged weapons and/or [magic](magic.md).

In games where monsters have an [inventory](inventory.md), orcs will typically be equipped with a variety of [weapons](weapon.md), [armor](armor.md), and possibly other [items](items.md). If the game ascribes racial workmanship to items, orcs will normally carry "orcish" gear.

Orcs usually appear in groups and act aggressively. In a game which uses the concept of alignment, orcs will normally be evil or [chaotic](chaos.md).

Orcs are well-liked by roguelike creators because they are excellent fantasy sword-fodder, evil and violent, but capable enough to appear through many different [levels](level.md) of the [dungeon](dungeon.md). They also can be represented in [ASCII](ascii.md) by the letter 'o', which doesn't have a lot of options.

Orcs are sometimes available as a playable [race](race.md).
