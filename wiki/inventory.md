# Inventory

---

Most roguelikes allow the player to have an inventory of [items](items.md) to use at his/her convenience. The way the inventory works differs quite a lot between different games.

The inventory is in most roguelikes represented as a list of [items](items.md), sometimes categorized by item type. Some roguelikes limit the inventory to a specific number of [items](items.md) while others limit the inventory to a specific weight or volume of [items](items.md) carried (based on the character's strength).

In some games there is no difference between the player's inventory and the wielded/worn [equipment](equipment.md) while others have one list for the inventory and one for the equipment.

It is also possible for characters other than the player (aka "[monsters](monster.md))") to have inventories. In some cases these are merely items carried, but usually the implementation of monster inventories is done in order to have monsters use items.
