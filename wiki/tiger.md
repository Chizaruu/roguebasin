# Tiger

---

The tiger is a large member of the [cat](cat.md) family. It attacks with its claws and bite. While primarily a solitary animal, two or three young tigers may hunt together. Tigers are good swimmers and do not mind water, so if a game includes swimming, tigers should have that ability. Tigers have excellent senses and are capable of great stealth.
