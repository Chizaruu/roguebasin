# Trousers

---

Trousers are clothing ([armor](armor.md) in roguelike terms) covering and offering some level of protection to the legs and groin. They are rather rare in roguelike games, with their appearance in [Steamband](steamband.md) probably constituting a first. Traditionally, they seem to be assumed under [body armor](body_armor.md), although many types of body armor do not include any sort of lower body covering.

Goal of Quest For Pants is to find some trousers.
