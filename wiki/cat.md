# Cat

---

**Cats** is ambiguous between meaning feline animals in general or the domestic house cat. Either is suitable as a source of roguelike encounters.

In a game that uses pets, a house cat would be a typical starting pet.

Wild cats such as [lions](lion.md), [tigers](tiger.md), leopards, cheetahs, panthers, lynxes, bobcats, etc. are fairly common roguelike [monsters](monster.md). These animals tend to be quick predators with a combination of biting and clawing attacks.

The house cat should not be ignored, however. While a modest encounter in terms of combat threat, the cat is associated with [magic](magic.md) use and could be given some special game abilities as a familiar. They might be given the ability to see [invisible](invisible.md) characters (an ability of their larger cousins might also be given).

In the [ADOM](adom.md) community cats are a frequent source of frustration because there is incentive to keep them alive even though they are often hostile.
