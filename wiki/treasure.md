# Treasure

---

Treasure is random [items](items.md) you find scattered around the [dungeon](dungeon.md) map, or left behind by defeated [monsters](monster.md). It can range from almost useless trash (a rat skeleton), to useful or magical items, or even just [gold](gold.md) coins. It may be hidden or locked away in chests or behind [traps](trap.md). Items may be unknown until properly identified, and reveal themselves to be terribly cursed (a cursed helm of blindness) or unexpectedly blessed (a rapier of demon-slaying).

You may need to carry promising bits back to town level to sell or appraise.

You may find surprising other uses for some items, e.g. throwing a [potion](potion.md) of [blindness](blindness.md). Treasure is a perspective on the general category of items.

A singular game winning treasure could be e.g. retrieving Rodney's amulet of Yendor.
