# Line wrapping in C

---

```c
/*
  This code provides a minimal way to do line wrapping in C.

  strwrap() will take an input string and a desired line width and
  attempt to split it into suitable chunks.

  The result will be provided as an array of string pointers, each
  referring to the position of the first character on a line.

  It tries to be clever about whitespace and start each line at the
  beginning of a word (it will not erase whitespace in the middle of
  lines). Newlines encountered in the string will be converted into
  dummy lines of 0 width.

  How to use:
  - Prepare the text you wish to wrap
  - Call strwrap()
  - Print the result line by line
  - Free the arrays strwrap() returned

  The code was designed with the following restrictions:
  - the original string must remain unmodified
  - everything contained in a single function
  - no structs or declarations (also helps minimize cleanup)

  Realistic expectations: There is no support for wide characters. It
  has no notion of control codes or formatting markup and will treat
  these just like regular words. It doesn't really care about tabs. It
  doesn't do anything about line raggedness or hyphenation.

  This code is meant to be educational and hasn't been overly
  optimized. I could probably use char pointers instead of array
  offsets in many places. However, keeping it this way should make
  it easier to adapt for other languages.

  main() provides a small test program.

  Compile with something like: gcc strwrap.c -o strwraptest

  You may use this code in your program. Please don't distribute
  modified versions without clearly stating you have changed it.
