# Rgrd Chatroom

---

The #rgrd chatroom is an IRC chatroom where various roguelike developers and players from Temple of the Roguelike and the rgrd newsgroup hang out. The topic is quite often roguelikes and roguelike development, but chat concerning everything comes up at some time or another.

Ultimately the #rgrd channel is a general chatroom for members of the roguelike community.

## How to connect with a standalone client

---

You'll need an IRC client, such as WeeChat, XChat (and its clones, like HexChat or PChat), or Quassel IRC. After that, you'll need to connect to irc.quakenet.org and join the room #rgrd. (type /join #rgrd). Alternatively, you can click [this link](irc://irc.quakenet.org:6667/rgrd) which will automatically connect you if your browser supports it.

IRC is a real-time medium of communication, but don't expect questions to be answered right away. If there's no active conversation, it's likely to take people five to ten minutes to notice that you've said anything at all. Be patient.

## Connect via the web

Use Quakenet's [webchat client](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=rgrd).
