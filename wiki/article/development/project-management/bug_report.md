# Bug Report

---

[Bug](bug.md) Reports are one of the most important feedback sources for a roguelike project, and are obtained from the testers and players.  

Using a collection of bug-reports, the developer is able to work in a sequential list seeking to perfect his program, thus making development of the game go faster than if the developer were to test all possible fail cases.  

Some roguelikes have websites that allow an automated bug report and [RFE](rfe.md) handling.
