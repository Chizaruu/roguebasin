# Class

A class, as [roguelike](what_a_roguelike_is.md) games borrow the term from role-playing games defines certain common characteristics among a group of conceivable characters. These include tendencies in their attributes, the ability to perform certain actions, and the ability to use or wear specific kinds of equipment amongst many other things.  

Some roguelikes use classes derived directly from [Dungeons and Dragons](../../dungeons_and_dragons.md), such as  

## [Warrior](../../../class/warrior.md) (Fighter)

Warriors tend to be physical based, attacking their enemies straight on with weapons rather than through magic or trickery. Warriors are generally best when wearing heavy armor and/or heavy weapons rather than light armor or sword and shield.
