# Random generation

---

One of the major features of roguelikes is that most of the in-game content is randomly generated, this means that a special algorithm dependant on a [random number generator](../../implementation/useful-algorithms-and-code/random_number_generator.md) is used to define certain characteristics of the ingame world, items or monsters that the PC meets. This makes roguelikes unique, as the replayability factor is as high to keep people playing the same game for more than 10 years, even if they don't win.
