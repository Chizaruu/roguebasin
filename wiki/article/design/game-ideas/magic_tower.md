Lots of spires, gargoyles, and pointy bits. Plus a balcony to walk out
on and look down on the world with contempt/fury/wistfulness depending
on mood. Usually with a storm in the background.

Freudian symbolism.

Oh, those, too, although realistically sized towers are far too
cramped to house a serious army.

Tower could harness wind/lightning from those storms in the background
for power, or increase range of line-of-sight spells. Don't forget
imprisoning enemies you can't kill for some contrived reason, or
locking up your beautiful daughter away from the world. And high
landing sites are favored for some flying beasties and docking
lighter-than-air ships.

One would mostly go outside to do the training, also to let the
hellbeasts poop
