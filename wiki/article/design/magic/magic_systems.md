# Magic systems

---

A magic system typically defines a set of non-standard attacks and effects which are limited by an in-game restriction, such as a resource required to use those abilities. A magic system might be derived from the games lore, or the other way around.  

## Costs / Restrictions

---

It is quite common to combine more than one of these methods.  

A Mana/Chance system might allow memorization of any number of [spells](spell.md), with the drawback that they cost mana and may fail. [NetHack](../../../game/nethack.md) does this.  

A Slot/Mana/Chance system might allow you to memorize a short list of spells, which then may be cast as above. [Crawl](../../../game/linleys_dungeon_crawl.md) does this.  

### Single-pool ([Mana](../../mana.md), Stamina)

[Spells](spell.md) consume spell points from a separate unique resource (usually given a short name like 'MP' or 'SP') when cast, but spellcasting is otherwise unrestricted. Variations include: 'Aspected Mana'/`Multi-pool` (fire mana, water mana, offensive mana, defensive mana, etc.); spells consuming things other than mana ([hit points](../../hit_points.md), material components, food/nutrition, etc.); [spells](spell.md) consume more than one type of thing/aspect of mana (e.g. 3 fire mana and a stick of charcoal).  

### Slot-based

[Spells](spell.md) must be prepared in advance, after which it may be cast at any time. In many systems, once a spell is cast, it is consumed; to cast a spell twice, it must be prepared twice. Typically the maximum number of spells that can be prepared is finite, either with an explicit cap ('Slots'), or by requiring a finite resource (i.e. material components). Variations include: more powerful spells require more slots/resources; [D&D](../../dungeons_and_dragons.md-style leveled slots; prerequisite spells that implicitly consume extra slots for powerful spells.  

### Chance-Based

Spellcasting is essentially free, but has a large chance of failure, especially for high-level spells. A variant is to have the chance of failure be affected by some combination [stats](../../stat.md), skill, or environment.
