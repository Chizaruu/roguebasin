# Artifact

---

An artifact is a unique [item](items.md), usually named. This usage is taken from [Dungeons and Dragons](dungeons_and_dragons.md). Artifacts may be predefined or they are sometimes generated randomly during play. They may simply combine attributes of items found elsewhere in the game or they may have special bits of code written for them to allow truly unique behaviors. They are generally either impossible to destroy or hardier than other items in the game. In some games, [gods](god.md) will gift them to those who gain their favor.
