# Blindness

---

Blindness is a condition in which a character cannot see. Typical game effects of blindness are:

- **Screen modification**: If the [player character](player_character.md) is blind, non-permanent aspects of the map (such as [monsters](monster.md)) may not be shown.
- **Combat impairment**: The blind character may suffer a penalty or penalties in combat.
- **Restricted actions**: The blind character may be unable to use missile weapons or cast [spells](spell.md). It is very typical that the character will be unable to read a [book](book.md), [scroll](scroll.md), or other writing while blind.
- **Message modification**: Text messages for the player may be changed when his character is blind. For example, when hit by a fire ball, the message may change from the normal "The horned elf mage casts a fireball! You are engulfed in flames!" to "You hear elvish chanting. Suddenly it is painfully hot!".
