# Gold

---

Gold, coppers or silver is a basic money points currency in roguelike games. It can be found or earned in the [dungeon](dungeon.md), sometimes by selling found, mined or crafted items to [NPCs](npc.md). Gold can be spent to buy [items](items.md) or resources from a [shop](shop.md) - food and drink, lamp oil, ammunition, weapons, armor and clothes, magical items or [skill](skill.md) training, repairs, or even lodging, to mention some. Gold often forms part of the [players](player.md) game progression, with more powerful expensive items only available once the player has advanced far enough to afford them. It often forms part of the gather-items, then-sell-in-town loop.
