# Mouse

---

The use of **mice** as an interface in roguelike games was never seen in the earlier major roguelikes, since no (or very few) terminal emulators have mouse interface support. However, more recent roguelikes (and alternate interfaces to older roguelikes) have supported mice, due to their potential advantages, such as selecting tiles for a "look" command.

A particularly good example of combining mouse and keyboard interfaces is [Ascii Sector](ascii_sector.md), in the ship navigation menu and Quine 5000.
