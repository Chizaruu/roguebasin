# Termite

---

The termite is a social insect, like the [ant](ant.md) or the bee, but it has been sadly neglected by roguelikes. Termites are well-known for eating [wood](wood.md), surely a useful monster talent in a roguelike game. Some termites build large mounds as dwellings, suitable adventure sites when scaled up for the giant termites that would serve as monsters (or when approached by tiny adventurers).
