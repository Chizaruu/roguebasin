## What is Hy?

---

From the official [documentation](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/):

"Hy is a wonderful dialect of Lisp thatâ€™s embedded in Python. Since Hy transforms its lisp code into the python Abstract Syntax Tree, you have the whole beautiful world of python at your fingertips, in lisp form!"

A quick reference of features can be found [here](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/language/index.html).

## Roguelike Specific Details

---

Since Hy is embedded into Python, most of the features of Python are available for Hy. Hy shares the strong and weak points of Python. Strong functional capabilities of Python are enhanced with macros and slowly growing core library. The language itself is still in beta stages and evolving.
