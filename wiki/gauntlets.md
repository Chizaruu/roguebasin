# Gauntlets

---

Gauntlets are [armor](armor.md) for the hands. They are like [gloves](gloves.md), only they typically offer better protection against attacks and will hinder fine finger movement more. Gauntlets may be of mail or plate armor design; sometimes they will appear in versions made of exotic materials like magical metals, crystal, or other such fantasies.
