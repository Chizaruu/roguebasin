# Weapon

---

Something you hurt monsters with. Types include [melee](melee.md) weapons such as swords and ranged weapons such as crossbows. Weapons are usually divided into different types, like "axes" or "maces&flails". There is often a skill for each weapon type.

Weapons usually carry an enchantment, called a "plus", which modifies a weapon's damage and/or accuracy. Some games (like [Crawl](linleys_dungeon_crawl.md)) have two different pluses, one for accuracy and one for damage. There are almost always ways of magically increasing a weapon's plus.

Some games have artifact weapons that carry magical powers.
