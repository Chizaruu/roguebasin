# Cloak

---

A cloak is a protective garment worn over other clothing. In reality, it protects the wearer from the weather, but in roguelike games it is typically a form of [armor](armor.md). If it has a [sticky curse](sticky_curse.md), in some games this will also prevent you from changing your [body armor](body_armor.md) in addition to your cloak, since the cloak is worn over the body armor.

Wearing a cloak can have some additional benefits such as reduction of damage from liquids (typically [acid](acid.md)) or the protection of other [equipment](inventory.md) from environment hazards such as rust.
