# Rock

---

[Dungeons](dungeon.md) are usually made of rock, as are a number of things to be found in them, including some types of wands, amulets, [stairs](stairs.md), [doors](door.md), and [monsters](monster.md). Sometimes a game will distinguish between rock and [stone](stone.md) in some way, although others choose specific mineral names for different types of rock/stone.

In the roguelike [KING](king.md) the ultimate goal is to collect a certain number of rocks.
