# Scroll

---

A very common type of magical item found in roguelikes is the scroll. Scrolls tend to have the following characteristics:

- Their descriptions are randomized each game and are typically given nonsense titles.
- They are single-use items.
- They require no skill to use, but [blindness](blindness.md), darkness, or other conditions may prevent their use.
- They are vulnerable to fire.

Scrolls are also the obvious choice for ways to learn [spells](spell.md) if a developer does not want to have a separate "[book](book.md" item type.
