# Casino

---

A casino is a gambling establishment. The best known casino in a roguelike game is the one in [ADOM](adom.md). Casinos also play a significant part in [Elona](elona.md). They are more suitable to more modern settings with a lesser emphasis on hack and slash, but could appear in a variety of setting with a variety of purposes. The most obvious is simply a place to allow a player to risk his fortune to make a bigger one, but that's not very creative.

- Casino of the Undead: Roll dem bones!
- In games with magical cards or dice, they might be acquired here.
- Casino themed enemies. Think Alice in Wonderland cards, dice golems, one-armed bandits.
- Magical card decks.
