# Mutation

---

A mutation is a biological or magical change to a [monster](monster.md) or more commonly to the [PC](player_character.md). It might be purely cosmetic (like having changed eye color) or heavily affect [gameplay](articles.md). Mutations do not necessarily have to be bad; sometimes they are neutral for certain player [classes](class.md) or [races](race.md) or even quite beneficial.

There are many ways to mutate and it is specific for each game. [Chaos](chaos.md) presence, [magical](magic.md) contamination, [radiation](radiation.md), [spells](spell.md), [items](items.md) infused with distortional energy are just few to be named. In [Alphaman](alphaman.md), you are born with mutant abilities. Depending on the circumstances, the strength and type of change made to the subject entity may vary. Eating a corpse of a high chaos servant probably will twist the [PC](player_character.md) a lot more than indirect exposure to radioactivity would. Finally, some [races](race.md) have a tendency to mutate on [level](level.md) advancement.

A mutation may do none, some or all of the following:

- Modify a statistic, an [attribute](attribute.md) or other factors.
- Change, add, or remove limbs or other body parts.
  - This may result in extra [melee](melee.md) attacks.
- Give, modify or take away [skills](skill.md) or special abilities.
- Change [magical](magic.md) potential and connection to [mana](mana.md) flow.
- Change the way shopkeepers, [gods](god.md), and others react to you.
- Provide new attacks and defenses, or create vulnerabilities.
- Change your sex, race, class, or other "permanent" characteristics. See also [polymorph](polymorph.md).
- Make you wear tight spandex with X logos. No wait, that's just in the Marvel Universe.

Total quantity of mutation may also be important. For example, [hunger](hunger.md) rate might increase with each new mutation or a magical chaos gate might only let you pass if you have a minimum number of mutations. You might become more or less likely to mutate with increasing numbers of mutations.

Mutation is highly important in [ADOM](adom.md), where it provides a (limited) [clock](time_systems.md) as mutation threat increases with game [time](time_systems.md) and mutation is (unusually in a [roguelike](what_a_roguelike_is.md)) potentially game-ending. [Crawl](linleys_dungeon_crawl.md) and several [Angband variants](list_of_angband_variants.md) also have mutations, just among the major roguelikes.
