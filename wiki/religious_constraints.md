(From the classic religions)  

* Taking a pilgrimage walk (with restrains like unarmed or with heavy religious objects) to a distant location
* Pray for at least "X" times a day (visit the church/temple each day/week)
* Sacrifice to the gods an amount of food equal to the amount you eat (half ration)
* Self mutilation for breaking any of the religious rules
* Crusade, kill everyone with a different religion (and destroy their temples)
* Scoring points for the afterlife, do quests for your god/priest, convert people to your religion and build temples  

(From the New Age nonsense(with all respect of course)  

* Only allow negative/positive energy in your aura (maintain a minimum distant from evil/good creatures)
* Eat only food you've grown yourself (don't pick up any food in the dungeon, you don't know where it's been!)
* Put skill points/experience into stats that don't have any benefits in the game (like soul and spirit)
* Don't use a mobile phone (or any other object that contains evil/good magic energy)
