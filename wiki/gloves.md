# Gloves

---

Gloves are protective coverings for the hands. They are considered a form of [armor](armor.md) in roguelike terms. They usually provide minimal protection against attacks, but may have special abilities, such as bonuses to [stats](stat.md) such as strength or dexterity.

If [sticky cursed](sticky_curse.md), gloves may prevent taking off or putting on rings.

Gloves may interfere with activities that require fine finger movements, such as casting [spells](spell.md) or picking locks. Some magical gloves may negate these penalties or even enhance one's skill in these activities.

Some possible glove types: leather, gardening, workman's, silk, fingerless lace, boxing.
