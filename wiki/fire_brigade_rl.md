# Fire Brigade RL

---

(by Antonie)

Yet another 7DRL idea... "FireBrigadeRL"

Outdoor map with trees and rivers. The @ is a ranger, the objective is to put out the forest fires. The fire slowly grows, you run around with your bucket and douse it, you have your axe to cut down trees and slow the progress of the fire. The orcs come with torches and start fires, you drive them off and put the fire out. As you get more powerful you can summon rainclouds to put the fire out, or you can build watchtowers to shoot the orcs when they come within a certain radius, or you can teleport to where the fire is.

You lose when the whole forest burns down.
