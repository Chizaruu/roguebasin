## Background

---

Fortran is a general-purpose programming language developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. The latest Fortran standards 2003 and 2008 added support for object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and parallel processing. Libraries written in [C](c.md) can be linked with the iso_c_binding module. Interfaces to [ncurses](ncurses.md), xlib, and [OpenGL](opengl.md) exist. Some Fortran compilers have Unicode support.

## Compilers

---

Several commercial and open-source Fortran compilers are available for [Linux](linux.md), [Unix](unix.md), [macOS](mac_os_x.md), [Windows](windows.md), [DOS](dos.md), and others (see [Fortran Wiki](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Compilers)). GNU Fortran is part of the GNU Compiler Collection, Flang is a Fortran front-end for LLVM. Both support the Fortran standards 2003 and 2008.
