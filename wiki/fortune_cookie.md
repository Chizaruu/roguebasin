# Fortune cookie

---

**Fortune cookie** is an [item](items.md) sometimes found in roguelike games. It can be eaten to obtain a random hint (sometimes false) (aka a rumor) and sometimes also for a few [nutrition points](hunger.md).

[Ragnarok](ragnarok.md) features ravens as messengers of Odin. These will speak a random hint when adjacent to [player character](player_character.md).
