# Helmet

---

A helmet is a fairly hard protective covering for the head. In addition to providing general or localized [armor](armor.md) protection (depending on whether a hit location system is used in combat), a helmet may:

- provide a bonus to head butt attacks
- reduce or eliminate certain types of damage
  - falling rock traps
  - stuns in [melee](melee.md)
  - damage from falling off a bicycle
- reduce perception
  - reduce information from dungeon sounds
  - restrict visual range
  - apply a penalty to certain [skills](skill.md)
- assist in disguise (e.g., orcish helm hiding features)
- avoid violating the law in modern/futuristic settings
