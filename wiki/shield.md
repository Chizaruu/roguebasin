# Shield

---

A shield is an unusual piece of [armor](armor.md). It is worn on the arm or held in the hand and is not usable with a two-handed [weapon](weapon.md) in games that try to be "realistic" about equipment or want a balancing factor because two-handed weapons are considered powerful. In a [skill](skill.md)-centered game, shields often have their own skill. The protection that comes from a shield may function through a separate "blocking" mechanic that differs from the mechanics of normal armor protection.

Some games allow a shield to be used to attack with a "shield bash" that is typically an additional attack in [melee](melee.md).

Shields typically come in a variety of sizes and, sometimes, materials.
