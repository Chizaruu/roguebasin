# Polymorph

---

Total change of [monster](monster.md) (or [player character](player_character.md)) into another creature. Change of [item](items.md) into another of the same type. [NetHack](nethack.md) is an example of a polymorph-heavy game.

Polymorph [spells](spell.md) are often viewed as being very unbalancing. However, when a developer makes it costly enough to outweigh its [exploitableness](cheating.md), it becomes never worth using.
