# Paladin

---

The Paladin is a holy warrior. As a game archetype it originates in [Dungeons & Dragons](dungeons_and_dragons.md), which really couldn't decide if he was supposed to be a medieval religious fanatic or a modern cop. Fortunately, we are discussing [roguelike](what_a_roguelike_is.md) games and can ignore such role-playing considerations.

A Paladin typically is good in [melee](melee.md), but not necessarily in ranged combat. He has special holy powers that help him to smite demon and the [undead](undead.md). He may also have [spell](spell.md) casting abilities and will have a close relationship to his [god](god.md), if religious elements are included in the game. Stereotypical Paladins will also wear a lot of [armor](armor.md).
