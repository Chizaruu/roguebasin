# Articles

---

This is a listing of articles, arranged by subject.

Articles under "design" will help the developer make decisions about gameplay. Articles under "implementation" will help with algorithm design, and offer various methods of implementing features. Headings are arranged in a general chronological order of development. Large lists of ideas (items, spells, themes, etc.) are in bold.

### Line of sight, field of vision

* [Line of Sight](article/implementation/line-of-sight-field-of-vision/line_of_sight.md) is used to determine when a specific destination square is visible from a source square. This can be used to determine whether a player is visible to a monster, the path an arrow takes to a particular enemy, and as a building block for a field of vision algorithm.
* [Field of Vision](article/implementation/line-of-sight-field-of-vision/field_of_vision.md) determines all squares visible from a particular source. This is useful when determining which squares to show a player, what squares are lit up by a light source, etc.
