# Open ended

---

"Open ended" or "open-ended" is a term used to refer to roguelikes that have no win condition and can thus continue forever. Such games continue until the player loses or stops playing. This often applies to survival games, such as [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](cataclysmdda.md) and [UnReal World](unreal_world.md), but roguelikes with infinite floors or character progression are also generally open ended. "Sandbox" is another term often used to refer to open ended games, though it implies that the game has virtually no difficulty, contrary to the definition of a roguelike.
