# Melee

---

Melee is close quarter physical combat.

In most roguelikes bumping into an enemy with the normal movement interface causes a melee attack.

Melee attacks are typically not guaranteed to hit. The specific mechanics of such combat vary greatly from game to game and these differences are frequently a fundamental feature of the gameplay experience.

Most roguelikes feature a wielded [weapon](weapon.md) or two which will be used automatically during attacks. The worn [armor](armor.md) and [shield](shield.md) of the target will affect the outcome.

Some common considerations when designing a melee system include

- Can they be dodged?
- Are they blockable?
- Can specific body parts be targeted?
- Are there secondary effects from an attack?
  - Magical effects might be triggered
  - Durability of armor hit might be reduced
- Are there bonuses and/or penalties based on opponents equipment?
- Which stats apply at which stages of the attack?
- Are there stances allowing adjusted chances of hitting, damaging, etc.?
