# Finding or Creating Sound and Music

---

Having sounds or music in a roguelike is rare. But not unheard of. For a developer creating his/her own sound or music can be hard. But there are some tools that could help a developer in creating their own sounds.

## Tools

---

- [DrPetter's sfxr](http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html) A tool to randomly generate sound effects using a few settings. Mostly useful for creating oldschool sound effects. (mac port: [cfxr](http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr))
- [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) Another generation tool.

## Free sound/music sources

When adding links, please make note of:
