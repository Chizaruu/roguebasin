# Dump Stat

---

**A dump stat** is a [stat](stat.md) that is not allocated any resources to or is not intentionally increased. A dump stat can either be a stat that is not used by a certain [class](class.md), [race](race.md), or character build, or in games where points can be allocated at certain stages of gameplay, simply ignored, and possibly subtracted from in order to allocate more development points to other stats. An example of the former may be [Dungeons & Dragons](dungeons_and_dragons.md) or [NetHack](nethack.md), where a barbarian is not expected to have a very high intelligence or wisdom at the beginning of a game, nor might a wizard have a high strength or constitution. An example of the latter may be the stats assigned to adventurers at the beginning of [Dwarf Fortress](slaves_to_armok_II_dwarf_fortress.md) Adventure Mode, where skills that may not ever be used (such as musicality) can be reduced to increase skills that may be of more use.
