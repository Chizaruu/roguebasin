# Stash

---

A Stash is a collection of [items](items.md) that the [player](player.md) leaves somewhere in the dungeon with the intention of returning there later should one of those items prove necessary/useful. Stashing often occurs in games with [persistent](dungeon_persistence.md) levels in which the number of [items](items.md) the [PC](player_character.md) can carry is limited.

The quintessential game in which stashing is a frequently used strategy is [Nethack](nethack.md).
