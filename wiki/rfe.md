# RFE

---

Stands for 'Request for Enhancement'  

This is a common communication channel for player/testers to submit their ideas that could make the game better/cooler.  

Some projects have automated websites to collect and track RFEs from their players, some others just keep it on a spreadsheet or inside their heads.
