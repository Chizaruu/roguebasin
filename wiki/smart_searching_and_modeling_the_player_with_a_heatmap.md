# Smart searching and Modeling the player with a "heatmap"

---

## Overview

---

I wanted a somewhat smart way for the guards to search for the player in [Shinobi](shinobi.md), as they lose visual contact, without giving them any information they should not have. This algorithm allows guards to collaboratively search for player and narrow down areas player cannot be.

PROS:

- Monsters can have a relatively good idea where player is when out of vision.
- Allows them to follow into corridors without needing player position.
- Monsters can't know where you went if 2 possible routes.

CONS:

- Might be processing intensive (?)
- Spreads only on "fresh" edges of the heatmap. Allows player to slip into already searched area. (Actually you could consider this realistic and a +)
- Is unreliable if player has ability to move a lot farther on some turns (like teleports/blinks etc.)

How it works

- You need some kind of heatmap. I used 2 sets of points (has quite good performance in my opinion. Could be better of course)
- When a player is seen, heat is reset and tile player is on gets heat
- Each turn, spread heatmap at the speed the player can move.
- For each monster (that uses heatmap) clear all tiles in monster fov.Â¨
- For actually searching the player, you might want to just pathfind to closest tile with heat

Here is heatmap demonstrated in action in Shinobi:

## Example code

Here is my implementation used in [Shinobi](shinobi.md) in [JavaScript](javascript.md). Uses Set from collections.js.

```javascript
//HEATMAP HANDLING
var Heat = {
  time: 0,
  oldNodes: null,
  freshNodes: null,

  //Initialize things. Called whenever heatlevel has to be cleared
  init: function () {
    this.oldNodes = new Set(null, this._equals, this._hash);
    this.freshNodes = new Set(null, this._equals, this._hash);
    this.time = 0;
  },
  //Add node in specified coordinates. Heatlevel spreads from there max. time nodes
  set: function (x, y, time) {
    this.freshNodes.add([x, y]);
    this.time = time;
  },

  neighbors: function (node) {
    var i, j;
    var n = new Set();

    //3x3 grid around current node, TODO: Util.lightPasses might have to be refactored into something else later
    for (i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
      for (j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
        if (Util.walkable(node[0] + i, node[1] + j)) {
          n.add([node[0] + i, node[1] + j]);
        }
      }
    }

    return n;
  },
  //Spreads the heat one iteration
  spread: function () {
    //Dont spread if time = 0
    if (this.time < 1) return;
    me = this;
    //Get next iteration of nodes
    var newNodes = new Set(null, this._equals, this._hash);
    this.freshNodes.forEach(function (node) {
      newNodes.addEach(me.neighbors(node));
    });

    this.oldNodes.addEach(this.freshNodes);
    this.freshNodes = newNodes.difference(this.oldNodes);

    this.time -= 1;
  },
  //Returns possible neighbors for each node

  //Debugging. Draws the heatlevel over game. Atm called by pressing 'H'
  draw: function () {
    this.oldNodes.forEach(function (node) {
      var point = Util.cam(node[0], node[1]);
      Game.display.draw(point.x, point.y, ".", "#000", "#fb0");
    });
    this.freshNodes.forEach(function (node) {
      var point = Util.cam(node[0], node[1]);
      Game.display.draw(point.x, point.y, ".", "#000", "#bf0");
    });
  },

  //this._equals & this._hash, delegates(?) for the sets
  _equals: function (a, b) {
    if (a[0] == b[0] && a[1] == b[1]) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  },
  _hash: function (object) {
    return object[0] + "," + object[1]; //object[0]+300*object[1];
  },

  //Removes heat from coordinates. Atm called when guards see tiles.
  remove: function (x, y) {
    this.oldNodes.delete([x, y]);
    this.freshNodes.delete([x, y]);
  },

  //Find the closest heat
  find: function (x, y) {
    var dist, node, curDist;
    dist = 999999999;
    this.oldNodes.forEach(function (p) {
      curDist = Math.abs(x - p[0]) + Math.abs(y - p[1]);
      if (curDist < dist) {
        dist = curDist;
        node = p;
      }
    });
    this.freshNodes.forEach(function (p) {
      curDist = Math.abs(x - p[0]) + Math.abs(y - p[1]);
      if (curDist < dist) {
        dist = curDist;
        node = p;
      }
    });
    return node;
  },
};
```
