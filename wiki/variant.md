# Variant

---

A variant is a version of a game that has branched off from the original and develops along its own, different, path. [Angband](angband.md) has a great many variants. [Nethack](nethack.md) has typically had one active variant at a time. Features from variants are sometimes imported back into the original game as it develops.

Variant is a relative term and new variants can be spun off from older ones. Angband began as a [Moria](moria.md) variant and Angband spawned many variants including [Zangband](zangband.md), which in turn was the basis for various Zangband variants. Of these, [ToME](tome.md) became quite prominent and in recent years has spawned the [T-Engine](t-engine.md), designed to produce games based on the same [engine](roguelike_engine.md) which might also be considered a form of variant.
