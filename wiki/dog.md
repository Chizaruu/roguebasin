# Dog

---

Dogs are domesticated canines. They come in a wide range of types and sizes. Their primary attack is their bite. They are pack animals and may be encountered in small groups. They might also appear with [human](human.md) or [humanoid](humanoid.md) masters. Their keen sense of smell means they may be able to detect [invisible](invisible.md) characters or characters who are out of sight.

In a game that uses pets, a dog would be a typical starting pet. Encountered dogs might be made friendly by giving them [food](food.md) or playing with them (if you have a ball or stick[or wand]).
