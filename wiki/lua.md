# Lua

---

## Description

---

Lua is a very nice and easy-to-learn scripting language specifically designed to be embeddable and able to represent complex data.

## Features

---

- Clean syntax
- Simple, yet extremely powerful and extensible, data structure: tables (can be used as hashtables, vectors, arrays, lists, namespaces, objects, ...)
- Easily embeddable into existing projects
- Lightweight
- Very fast
- Compiled to bytecode, which can be saved to a file
- Easy integrated with all languages that can load C libraries (also [FreePascal](free_pascal.md)
- Many other nifty things ;)
- [lua makes info files obsolete](lua_makes_info_files_obsolete.md)

## Roguelike libraries

---

- [Astray](https://github.com/SiENcE/astray) (dungeon generation)
- [rotLove](https://github.com/paulofmandown/rotLove/issues), a port of [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/) (partly designed for the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) graphics library)

## Lua Engines

---

- [T-Engine](t-engine.md) is a fully fledged roguelike engine designed to be programmed in Lua

## Lua Roguelikes

---

Lua is probably the most popular scripting language for roguelikes.
rotLove based

- [Zomia](zomia.md) ([LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/))

### T-Engine based

- [ToME](tome.md) - a good part of the engine is in Lua and the game itself will be completly in Lua in the next version.
- [The Veins of the Earth](the_veins_of_the_earth.md) made using T-Engine 4
- [Bone to be Wild](bone_to_be_wild.md) Runs with T-Engine from ToME.
- [ODE](ode.md) Runs with T-Engine from ToME.
- [Broken Bottle](broken_bottle.md) made using the T-Engine4
- [Run from the Shadow](run_from_the_shadow.md) made using the T-Engine4
- [Harrowed](harrowed.md) made using the T-Engine4

### Slang based

- [Ascii Wilderness](ascii_wilderness.md) made entirely using Lua 5 and the Slang graphics interpereter.

### Standalone

- [Seduction Quest](seduction_quest.md) made using [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/).
- [Alchemist](alchemist.md) made using [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/).

### Custom support

- [Angband](angband.md) - between Angband 3.0.0 and 3.0.6. Since then it no longer supports Lua scripts.
- [DoomRL](doomrl.md) - internally keeping all it's data in Lua. Since 0.9.9.1 a limited form of modding using Lua is possible.
- [Portralis](portralis.md) - uses Lua a lot to create monster attacks and complex story and quest events. Many gameplay mechanics are now entirely script-based, and future versions will aim to expand it's use even further.
- [H-World](h-world.md) - all modding in this engine is done through Lua scripts
- [Necropolis (Timothy Pruett)](<necropolis_(timothy_pruett).md>) Using Lua scripting and custom-built tools users can create new areas, classes, items, etc.
