# Shoes

---

Shoes are a fairly rare variant of foot covering in roguelikes. Mostly characters wear armored [boots](boots.md), but some games include less protective shoes or sandals as well. Foot [armor](armor.md) has not been differentiated as much as hand or head armor, which can come in gloves vs. gauntlets or helmets vs. hats/caps vs. crowns.

Shoes could be made easier to run in than boots, while boots remain more protective. In a game with puns as a basis of gameplay, horses and centaurs could wear shoes, but not boots. Also, one might not be allowed to wear boots some places, like into the palace.
