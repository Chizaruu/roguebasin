# Skill

---

A Skill is commonly conceived as either:

* A value that defines how proficient a character is when performing a certain kind of action.
* An action that certain character is able to perform, optionally having an embedded proficiency value over this same action. These can be divided into
  * Active Skills: The character explicitly declares he is going to perform the skill, optionally defining different arguments for its execution.
  * Passive Skills: These skills are used expontaneously or implicitly, without direct input from the character.
